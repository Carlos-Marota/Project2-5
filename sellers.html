			<h2> Sellers requriements </h2>
			<p> There are certian requriements in other state but since we are california these are seven requriements that are needed by law to sell your house. These are the seven requriememnts by law to sell your house:</p>
            <p>Share your area's risk of natural hazards- In California it has their share of natural hazards and under California Civil Code requires the sellers provide an Natural Hazard Disclosure Statement to the buyers. Within seven days the NHD statement can not fail in these areas: A flood hazard zone designated by the Federal Emergency Mangement Agency, An area of potential flooding after a dam failure, An earthquake fault zone, A high fire hazard severity zone based on vegetation,topography, weather, and other factors, A wildland fire area, also called the "State Responsibility Area, A seismic hazard zone which includes areas prone to landsliders and liquefaction. Some things that may not seems like natural hazard but more of noise issue they would need include whether there airport, farm, ranch, abandoned well. gas pipeline, or even mining operation nearby.</p>
            <p>Fill out your disclosure form solo-As a seller you would need fill out the Transfer Disclosure Statement it is California official form that you need to disclosure any material facts, defects that could pose a risk to buyer health and safety or negatively impact their home value. As an agent we can help you fill out the form but can not write it for you as law states "seller handwriting only". </p>
            <p>Disclose any deaths that happens on the property within three years- Under California law no matter the cause of death it is deemed as a material fact and must be disclose to the buyers. Some buyers do not feel like buying a house with person who died within three years as they may think it can be haunted by ghost.</p>
            <p>Paying hefty transfers taxes- A real estate transfer tax is a fee that a seller need to pay to state, county, or municipality for the privilege of transferring real property within the jurisdicition. This transfer tax generates revenue for your city, county or state and even all three at the same time. In California the Taxation Code charges 55 cent per $550 or $1.10 per $1,000 of the transferred net value for state counties and if you live in Los Angeles County that has five different cities that charge additional fees ranging from $2.20 to $4.50 per $1,000. I know it sucks need pay taxes when selling but it California taxing everything nowdays.</p>
            <p>Alert buyers if wire fraud or other safety issues happens- This is mainly for added consumer protection, under California disclosures also make buyers aware of certain privacy and safety issues such as: Information about Megan's law and the registered sex offender database, A booklet about the statewide home energy rating program, Disclosure of any military ordnance (potentially explosive munitions) within one mile of the property, Disclosure of any water conserving fixtures for the property that was built prior to 1994, and an advisory about the potrntial for wire fraud when transferring funds electronically. </p>
            <p>Acknowlegde that your agent has other clients also- It important to acknowlegde that the agent may have other sellers to deal with and work with them on planning the open house and contracts. </p>
